Code, colors and cookies
=====================

Code for "Du code, des couleurs et des cookies" (Code, colors and cookies :-) a workshop designed for the Pompidou Center in Paris.

Kids and family remix computer code to create shapes, colors. They add, cut-and-paste, modify their code, can see the pictures change and evolve before their eyes, projected by 12 video-projectors– that's 1 video-projector per kid!

During the 2 hours of the workshop the kids and their family also go up in the museum to see 3 paintings from Kupka, Valensi and McDonald Wright dating from 1920 to 1955, discovering how computer code make us see them differently–and bringing back fresh ideas for their program: “We tried to imagine how to program the shapes that we saw in the paintings”.

We use Processing in Python Mode, for the cleaner syntax and the ease of passing a function as a parameter to another function.

This post briefly explain the motivation behind the design of the workshop (at the art, mediation and pedagogy levels): [http://ils.sont.la/post/programmer-au-musee-le-code-creatif-materiau-mediation](http://ils.sont.la/post/programmer-au-musee-le-code-creatif-materiau-mediation)
